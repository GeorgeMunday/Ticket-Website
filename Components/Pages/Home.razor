                This is my first time using MudBlazor, and I will be using it as a playground of sorts.
                Alongside, I will also be learning SQLite.
                This page will serve as documentation for what I learn.
                I will also include important commands here.
                If you find any of this useful, feel free to star the repository on GitHub and create a pull request if
                you
                see anything that could be improved.
